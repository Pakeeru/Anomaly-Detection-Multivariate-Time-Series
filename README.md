# Anomaly-Detection-Multivariate-Time-Series

This project explores anomaly detection in cardiovascular health data using Machine Learning methods, including
k-means clustering, isolation forest, and fuzzy c-means clustering. Focused on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database with 48 ECGs, our goal is early identification of potential cardiac irregularities. Our approach, incorporating majority voting of
multiple ML models, considers both temporal and variable
relationships to enhance precision. By unraveling intricacies in
this unique medical dataset, our study contributes to refined
anomaly detection methodologies, particularly in cardiac health
monitoring. The temporal nature of the 30-minute ECG records
provides a granular understanding of cardiac dynamics, enabling
the discernment of subtle patterns indicative of anomalies. In an
era of data-driven healthcare, our research signifies a notable
advancement, promising improved clinical decision-making and
healthcare delivery
